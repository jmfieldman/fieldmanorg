# Galaxy Simulation (2003)

In 2003, my friend Nick and I had been talking about space games (Master of Orion, Space Empires, etc) and how most of them use a 2D mapping system. Well, if i was ever going to write a 4X space game it would definitely have to be set in a 3D environment.

So to see if this was even plausible I spent a weekend and came up with a model of how a 3D galaxy could look. Itâ€™s probably the worst galaxy simulation program ever written. Bite me.
