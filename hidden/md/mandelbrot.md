# Mandelbrot (2001)

During one of my many Slashdot refreshes (circa 2001) I came across an article about the [mandelbrot set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set). I was intrigued by how simple it was, and decided to make my own viewer.

That evening I wrote the program from 9pm to 2am in one sitting, so it’s really not that high quality or special. I tried to beef it up with some extra options but didn’t really get too far. All I had time to implement was:

* Zoom in by drawing a box on the screen
* Variable colors
* Variable precision
* Undo last view change
* Reset the view to the beginning
* Zoom out
* Realign, in case you distort while zooming

That’s it. It’s actually pretty cool what kind of patterns you can find.
