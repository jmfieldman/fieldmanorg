# Loudtap (2009)

I met Yee Lee around ’08/’09 while we were both stationed in the Venrock office.
One of the interns had asked us both to lunch to discuss an app of his. During
lunch, Yee and I bonded over the idea of releasing a social app for skiers. That
collaboration pivoted into what would eventually be Loudtap.

Loudtap was our version of Textplus, WhatsApp, Gogii, etc. Basically a non-SMS
texting platform for the iPhone. We decided to integrate it with
Facebook, so there was no dealing with phone numbers. It was basically a precursor
to the Facebook Messenger app. Yee did all the server coding and I did all the app
coding.

It never really took off. After a few years, without any users, we decided to
disband the company and stop paying for servers/LLC taxes.

It was a fun experiment though. I learned a lot about network programming, and
got to make an app that replicated the messaging UI. There are a lot of challenges
in that (like scrolling the screen properly, resizing the text box as people type,
etc). It was also a neat introduction to push notifications.
