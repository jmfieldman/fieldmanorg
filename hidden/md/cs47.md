# CS47 (2009)

In 2009 I took a really cool Stanford Continuing Studies class about the history
and archaeology of Pompeii. The best part was that the professor also supervised
a dig in Pompeii, and at the completion of the class he was going to take everyone
to his dig site and do a personal week-long tour of the surrounding area.

On the trip I met the director of the continuing studies program, and he asked
if I’d like to teach a class on beginning iPhone development. I’d never really
done any teaching before, but it seemed like an opportunity I couldn’t pass up.

So I ended up teaching the [CS47](http://cs47.fieldman.org/) class from January to March of 2010. It was a
really great experience. For the final project, each student created a view
controller that did whatever they wanted, and I bundled all of their projects
into a single app which was published in the App Store.

The students really
surprised me with how much they learned, and the app is still [available today](https://itunes.apple.com/mu/app/stanford-continuing-studies/id364502043?mt=8).
