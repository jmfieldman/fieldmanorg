# Random Art (2001)

Colors can be represented by different amounts of red, green and blue. The random art generator graphs each of these three values determined by a randomly generated mathematical function inside of a bounded 2D plane. The equation for each picture is printed above it.

Sometimes math is boring, and sometimes it’s very interesting. This is reflected in the different kinds of pictures you’ll see. Since the equations are generated completely randomly, there is no guarantee that an interesting picture will be created.
