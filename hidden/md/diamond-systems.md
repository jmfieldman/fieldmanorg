# Diamond Systems

One of the greatest experiences at Diamond Systems was being given the opportunity to design a piece of hardware, the [Diamond-MM-32X-AT](http://www.diamondsystems.com/products/dmm32x), a hardware refresh of the existing 32-AT board.

I got to layout and route the entire analog section to improve speed and noise performance, completely re-architect the digital section, and move every component to the topside of the board to save a few pennies (and make it look cool).

In addition to the schematic, placement and routing of the board, I also wrote the code for the embedded microprocessor that handles temperature-based automatic calibration.

Itâ€™s weird looking at this board and still knowing what almost every chip does.
