# Time Capsule

In 8th grade I would regularly use PKZip to copy large files onto multiple floppy
disks before transporting them via bicycle to and from Sid Mal's house.  The disturbing
frequency of disk failure was a precious life lesson on the importance of backing
up with multiple redundancy.

Somehow most of my published exploits dating back to 2001 have survived and are
still viewable today.  Though embarrassing, I present them for their historic value.

The first is my original website from 2001, created as I began my fourth year
at Berkeley: [2001.fieldman.org](http://2001.fieldman.org)

The second is the evolution of that website a few years after graduation.  It has
similar content, but is an interesting look at what I thought a website should
evolve to in those few years: [2003.fieldman.org](http://2003.fieldman.org)
